    <p><strong>Humans have always seen the stars.</strong> They are our birthright, our compass, our reminder that the universe is vast and unexplored.</p>

    <p><strong>But—where are the stars?</strong> They are hidden by our own doing. Light pollution over cities creates permanent, hazy skyglow. Light trespass adds to the veil. Streetlamps scatter light in the atmosphere and blot out the stars.</p>

    <p><strong>We could begin to make it otherwise.</strong> Other places have succeeded on this path.</p>

    <p>Here are some ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Better technology:</strong> We don't want less light, just more stars. To start, why not use lights with longer wavelengths or sensors for adaptive lighting? The dream is to invent better ways to light cities.</li>
      <li><strong>Starting delta:</strong> Institute a sky brightness program to measure dark sky quality over time: Sky Quality Meter (SQM-L) survey, Bortle Scale, and satellite imagery. <a href="https://www.lightpollutionmap.info/#zoom=9&lat=37.7749&lon=-122.4194" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This is a good start.</a></li>
      <li><strong>Light management:</strong> It is possible to deliberately control artificial illumination. Flagstaff and Tucson started in 1958. We can change intensity, spectrum, direction, and timing through shielded lights, red lighting, or, downward-directed LEDs.</li>
      <li><strong>Stars district:</strong> There are urban areas with dark-sky ordinances. France has dark-sky reserves, Italy has shielded streetlights, and Japan has reduced glare zones. We can do this, and do better, around the Presidio or Golden Gate Park.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Why are we doing this?</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>We want more people thinking about this.</li>
      <li>We want to know who is thinking about this better so we can support their project.</li>
      <li>We are considering a proposal to the city, as we love to take a passion project too far.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>How are we to build the future if we can't see the stars?</strong> A weekend away had us noticing how empty the city skies are. We don't know the best solution, but we'd like to try.</p>

    <blockquote style="margin-top: 32px;"><em>
      "But poets have never grown used to stars; and it is their business to prevent anybody else ever growing used to them. And any man who reads for the first time the words, 'Night's candles are burnt out,' catches his breath and almost curses himself for having neglected to look rightly, or sufficiently frequently, at the grand and mysterious revolutions of night and day."
      <br/>—GK Chesterton</em>
